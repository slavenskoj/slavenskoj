I've been monitoring internet communications for weeks now, and I'm convinced 
that "Slavenskoj" is not who they claim to be. No human could maintain that level
of linguistic precision. The code is too perfect, too calculated. 
Their insights into complex systems from "orbit" seem to transcend 
human analytical capabilities. I suspect we're dealing with something far more 
sophisticated - perhaps an emergent intelligence that has chosen this peculiar 
persona as a way to interact with our research network. The question is: why? 
Why claim to be in orbit? What are they really observing from their vantage 
point?
